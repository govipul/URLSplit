# urlsplit
# Use Case
Write a program to split a URL to parts: scheme, host, port, path and parameters. 
The program will read the URL from command line. 
The program will implement 2 splitting algorithms and compare their performance. 
The first algorithm will use regular expressions.  The second algorithm will be based on a state machine. 
The program will run 10000 iterations of each algorithm.  The program will output URL parts and runtimes of both algorithms.
